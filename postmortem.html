        You can (and should) include both negative and positive points; they will not count against your project mark.
        It is highly recommended that you include the last three items from the list above.
        Also ensure that you discuss the area you identified for improvement after your iteration 2 retrospective; how did it go?
        This should be informal, you can choos
