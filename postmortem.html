            <h2>Overall Architecture</h2>
            <p>The Student Echo app adopts a three-tier architecture, ensuring a clear separation between the user interface, business logic, and database management. 
                The front end features intuitive activities for user interactions, while the back end runs on robust Java code ensuring logical operations are efficiently executed. 
                Data is managed through SQL, allowing for reliable and structured data storage and retrieval. 
                This design ensures maintainability, scalability, and a seamless user experience.</p>

            <h2>What Went Right</h2>
            <p>The development process saw the successful implementation of most planned features, fostering a positive team environment where collaboration and enjoyment went hand in hand.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>What Went Wrong</h2>
            <p>We faced the common challenge of merge conflicts, underestimating the complexity of our app's architecture and size, which led to a crunch time during system testing.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Starting Over</h2>
            <p>Looking back, a phased approach starting with a smaller project scope would have been beneficial, alongside integrating test-driven development from the start to avoid last-minute bugs.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Project Size and Composition</h2>
            <p>The project evolved to include numerous methods and classes with substantial time devoted to system testing, which was unexpectedly time-consuming.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Time Investment</h2>
            <p>The bulk of our time was invested in system testing, with UI design being the least time-consuming. Surprisingly, the amount of time required for tests was more than anticipated.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Design Decisions and Smells</h2>
            <p>Our decision to integrate Bookmarks and Action Alerts added significant value, though we did encounter code smells such as tight coupling that we aim to address.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Outstanding Bugs</h2>
            <p>Minor bugs remain post-development, providing learning opportunities for future projects.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Unexpectedly Successful Features</h2>
            <p>The Bookmarks and Notification features integrated seamlessly, exceeding our expectations in user engagement and functionality.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Development Techniques</h2>
            <p>While we did not employ specific methodologies like TDD or pair programming, regular and frequent meetings underpinned our project's progress.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Project Evolution</h2>
            <p>Our project's direction saw adjustments throughout its iterations, improving feature descriptions and user stories to better meet users' needs.</p>
